- allow for a "partial" interface. a partial interface is one which sneakily requires more than
  what is defined in the contract. those sneaky requirements can be defined via annotation
  - classgraph will scan for children of @PartialInterfaces, and ensure that they implement the sneaky requirements
- uses:
  - primitive-friendly parameterization
  - interfaces that require static methods
  - non-public methods in interface (?bad idea?)
  - constructor constraints?

questions:
- how can check() be triggered automatically at clinit time of the child class?

limitations:
- refactoring cannot be done automatically in an IDE

notes:
- varargs should be specified as eg int[].class, as under the covers that is how java treats it.

design notes:
- use class annotations, not method annotations, b/c of potential return type confusion
- use classgraph instead of ctor checks b/c an interface cannot run code at init or clinit time.
