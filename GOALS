- allow for a "partial" interface. a partial interface is one which sneakily requires more than
  what is defined in the contract. those sneaky requirements can be defined via annotation
  - classgraph will scan for children of @PartialInterfaces, and ensure that they implement the sneaky requirements
- uses:
  - primitive-friendly parameterization
  - interfaces that require static methods
